# sp-1-afx-justFallAsleep
First sonic pi work inspired by Aphex Twin, Just Fall Asleep song. <br />
The code can really be improved and optimized - but it was very fun :)<br />
Also I made a small concept art for the song using blender 3D - find 3D process [here](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/nEz1JE).
