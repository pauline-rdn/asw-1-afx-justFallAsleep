# asw-1-afx-justFallAsleep
First sonic pi work inspired by Aphex Twin, Just Fall Asleep song
Can really be improved and optimized - but had a lot of fun :)
Made a small art concept for the song using code, touch designer, blender & premiere pro - find complete project here & part of the process here.
